# odin-recipes
This small project is to consolidate my basic web design skill, especially html by building a recipe website.
At the end of this project and a couple other ones like it, I would have honed and demonstrated  my skill at using the most fundamental tool for web design - html. 

I state and reaffirm the above. So help me God.
