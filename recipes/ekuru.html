    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Ekuru is a meal native to the Yoruba people in Nigeria. 
      It is usually prepared with peeled beans. 
      It is similar to moin-moin as both are made from peeled black-eyed peas 
      or, occasionally, cowpeas. </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <hr>
      <ul>
          <li>3 Cups Black Eyed Beans or Brown</li>
          <li>3 Cooking Spoons Palm Oil</li>
          <li>1 Cup Dried Pepper (Ata Ijosi)</li>
          <li>1 Red Bell Pepper (3, if you can’t source Dried Pepper (Ata Ijosi)</li>
          <li>1 Scotch Bonnet</li>
          <li>1.5 Medium Onion</li>
          <li>2 Tablespoons Locust Beans (Iru)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <hr>
      <ol>
          <li>First soak and peel your Beans. Then blend with little water till semi-smooth, that’s not too smooth. Do not add too much water, your consistency should not be too thick nor too fluid, kind of in between. Then empty contents into a bowl.</li>
          <li>With a hand mixer, incorporate air into your Bean Batter by mixing for 10-15 minutes. Mix till very fluffy and frothy. If you haven’t got a hand mixer, you can use a wooden spoon or ladle, mix for 30 minutes. Traditionally, Ekuru batter is pounded in a mortar till fluffy.</li>
          <li>You’ll need to work your batter really well to achieve the signature Ekuru crumbly texture. If your batter isn’t fluffy enough, you’ll end up with a Moinmoin type texture or hard Ekuru, so, get mixing</li>
          <li>Scoop the batter into Banana leaves (Moinmoin leaves), Ramekins or Foil ame seal. Excuse my mess here, the leaves I got were way too small</li>
          <li>Steam till fully cooked, this should take roughly 30 minutes on medium heat.</li>
      </ol>
